React JS Project

Short description:
This is a React JS Student Project for the React JS Course, SoftUni (October 2023). The project has two main folders - client and server. The project includes the main React programming concepts as React Hooks, Context API, Routing, Route Guards, Error Boundaries, etc. React Router library has been used for the routing.The project is split into components for the main part of the pages and subcomponents for specific parts of the main pages. The server used for this project is the Softuni Practice Server in which data has been seeded.

The Idea of the Project:
This is an application for a special NFT collection. Both guests and users can review the catalog with the unique digital NFT art pieces. Also, there is a blog in which different topics related to the NFT trends can be discussed. There is a public part, for everyone who opens the website, and a private part, for every person who has registration.

The Project includes dynamic pages, specific views (as Catalog, Blog, NFT Post, Blog Post, My Profile), CRUD , authentication, error handling, data validations. The project mainly uses already created HTML and CSS templates (downloaded from https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page172/dopetrope). Additional HTML pages and CSS files have been added to the project so it meets the SoftUni requirements.
